# Afridata – African Dataset Hub

Afridata is a Django-based web application designed to serve as a centralized repository for datasets across Africa. It aims to promote open data access, enable collaboration, and empower individuals and institutions to share, explore, and utilize datasets across multiple domains such as education, health, governance, agriculture, environment, and development.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Afridata is not just a data repository — it's a community platform that supports dataset discovery, dataset contributions, API access, and data-driven discussions. It provides a unified, structured interface for managing and accessing datasets relevant to the African continent.

Key objectives:
- Centralize African datasets across disciplines and sectors.
- Provide authenticated access to upload, download, and manage datasets.
- Enable open collaboration through community forums.
- Offer programmatic dataset access via a RESTful API.

## ⚙️ Core Features

- **Dataset Upload & Download**: Authenticated users can upload and download datasets in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, ZIP, etc.).
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and account management.
- **Dataset Metadata**: Each dataset includes structured metadata (title, description, tags, category, license, etc.).
- **Community Forum**: A space for users to discuss datasets, ask questions, or request specific data.
- **REST API Access**: External systems or researchers can access public datasets programmatically.
- **Search & Filtering**: Keyword-based and category-based dataset discovery.
- **Role Management**: Includes regular users, moderators, and admins.
